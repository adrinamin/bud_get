# bud_get

This is a basic budget planner written in C. It is a console application that can be run within the terminal.

This is my personal side project and it is still a work in progress!

But if you want to run this application, check out the repo and run `make`.
This will build a binary file in the `bin` directory. 
You can then run the file with `bin/bud_get`.
