# bud_get

This is a basic budgeting applictation written in C. It is a console application which can be run within the terminal.

This is my personal side project is still work in progress!

But if you really want to run this application, check out the repo and run `make`.
This will build a binary file in the `bin` directory. 
You can then run the file with `bin/bud_get`.
